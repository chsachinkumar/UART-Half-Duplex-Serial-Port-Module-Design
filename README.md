# UART Half Duplex Serial Port Module Design
This repository contains an **Front-End VLSI Projects** (ASIC)

The UART stands for **Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter**. It is a serial communication technique that eliminates the need of a clock to facilitate communication between two separate components on a device. In this project, I have explored UART, one of the most widely used communication interfaces that is crucial for microcontroller, computers, and packet sniffing. The design of a high speed UART is the main topic of this project. The study begins by using Verilog HDL to describe the behavior of a UART. This study will focus on transmitting and receiving of 1 byte data through designed UART.

In this project, designed UART is operated at the baud rate of 115200 Hz to synchronize transmitting and receiving UART. This project is designed for an study of basic UART module hence there is no parity module used.

**Topics focused:**
**1.** Introduction of UART and it's type
**2.** Bitstream (Packet Sniffing)
**3.** FSM model
**4.** Digital System Design (DSD)
**5.** Simulation Results based on power efficiency, thermal expansion and speed of data transfer.
