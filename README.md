# UART Half Duplex Serial Port Module Design
This repository contains an **Front-End VLSI Projects** (ASIC)<br />

<div style="text-align: justify">The <b>Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter</b>, or <b>UART</b>, is a method of serial communication that does not require a clock to transmit information between separate components within a device. The project examines the use of UART, a commonly used communication interface that is essential for microcontrollers, computers, and packet sniffing. The primary focus of the project is the design of a high-speed UART. The project utilizes Verilog HDL to describe the behavior of a UART, specifically focusing on the transmission and reception of one-byte data through the designed UART.

The project features a designed UART that operates at a baud rate of 115200 Hz to coordinate the transmission and reception of UART. The project is intended for a basic study of UART module, thus, no parity module is utilized.</div>
